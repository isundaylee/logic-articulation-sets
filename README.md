# Logic Pro Articulation Sets Generator

A Python script to generate Logic Pro articulation set files (.plist) for string instruments, mapping MIDI notes to articulation names.

## Overview

This tool generates Logic Pro articulation set files that map MIDI keyswitch notes to specific playing techniques (articulations) for string instruments. It's particularly useful for CineStrings Solo and similar sample libraries that use keyswitches to trigger different articulations.

## Usage

Simply copy the generated files under `output/` into `~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Articulation Settings`.
